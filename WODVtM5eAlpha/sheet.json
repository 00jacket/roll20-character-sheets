	"instructions": "Vampire: The Masquerade Character Sheet for use in the World of Darkness, 5th Edition's Alpha. Will propably be replaced by a proper sheet once 5E comes out. More or less a striped down version of CWOD V20 sheet. Designed to function much like an actual paper sheet would.  With the most notable exception being that you can roll Willpower directy from the sheet.  Also, The Dice Pool section in the center at the bottom allow one to select an Attribute and/or Ability to roll; The Other Traits may also be seleceted in the Ability drop down.  All rolls from the sheet are of the from {Xd10}>Df1, where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  NOTE: These roll do not recognize botches or specialties. Further, the rolls will prompt the user to modify the number of dice rolled and set the difficulty.  The defaults for these are 0 and 6 respectively.  Also, click on the Virtues Conscience or Self-Control to change to Conviction and Instinct, repectively, click again to change back."
