# Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2e Character Sheet

This work is based on original efforts by a Shawn Newsome.

The sheet has been revamped and a number of immediate errors addressed.

The original use of Honey Badger's PowerCards v1 has been removed, however, a feature is being planned to reintegrate v2 into the sheet (the current version, v2.3.5, replaces the older version in this repos).

Please submit bugs and feature requests to https://github.com/timothystone/roll20-character-sheets. Pull requests are
welcome.

## Future features
1. HoneyBadger PowerCards
2. Selectable Targets
3. More documentation for player macros
