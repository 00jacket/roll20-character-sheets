character sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.

There is no CP calculation, this sheet is purely for actual play and focuses on:
- Proper formatting for macros to keep chat clean.
- Made with options to allow for good experience via Text Only roll20.
- Clean and to the point design. Things are organized in Tabs to avoid scrolling up and down, etc

Otherwise, sheet is pretty much done and as far as I could tell, works perfectly fine.

CHANGELOG
06/05/2014:
- Fixed 1/2 and 1/3 HP calculation so that it's based off Max HP instead of Current HP.
- Split the Attack macro into an Attack (A) and a Damage (D) macros.
- Added an input text field below the Maneuver Declaration button. This is meant to be used to specify what you actually do when choosing Maneuvers like Ready, Concentrate, Wait and Change Posture. For other Maneuvers, just leave it blank.
- Changed "location" in inventory to a text field for wider compatibility.
- Changed TABINDEX across the board so that it'll ignore buttons and macros. You can now press TAB for quick data input usually.
- Fixed a couple Wounding Modifiers errors in the Damage Taken Calculator (below Armor DR panel)
- Changed weapon "type" to use a select list instead of text for ease of use and consistant formatting.
- Re-organised and Added entries for many select lists to offer more options and clarity.
- Added custom emote prompt for Active Defenses, Attacks, Consumables and Spell macros. For each of these, there will be an auto-filled in Default value as well (so you can just accept it and it stills looks ok).
- Slight improvement in layout in many places.
- Added and updated many tooltips (should appear at the top right corner of the sheet usually.)
- Known Issues: 
	- If you scroll down, tooltips can go off-screen.
