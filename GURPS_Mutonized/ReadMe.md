character sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.

There is no CP calculation, this sheet is purely for actual play and focuses on:
- Proper formatting for macros to keep chat clean.
- Made with options to allow for good experience via Text Only roll20.
- Clean and to the point design. Things are organized in Tabs to avoid scrolling up and down, etc

Otherwise, sheet is pretty much done and as far as I could tell, works perfectly fine.

minor TODO:
- Add field for maneuvers asking for it such as Ready, Change Posture, etc
- Polish macros with custom inputs to allow for user defined emotes.
