    "instructions": "**Fallout 2.0**\rWhole Sheet: I coped fallout 3.0 beautiful tabbed version and modified the formula to fit classic 2.0 version and added the tag skill boxes. \rPrime Tab: Include bio-blocks, Primary Statistics, and Secondary Statistics.  The Secondary Statistics auto-calc, with a block added for modifiers after the fact.\rSkill tab: The buttons roll a d100 and show the skill rating next to it\rCombat Tab: Armor records the rating, but is not calculated.  Current hitpoints are user-entered, but the maximum is auto-calc based on level.  The weapon buttons include a damage roll, regardless if the the roll hit.  \rTrait tab: A repeating field for recording perks, traits, and so on.  The trait names can be changed.\rInventoryTab: Another repeating field for recording gear.\rTo Do: vehicle tab, roll template (dev only) taking into account range, targetted attack roll with built range, targetted attack roll taking in account damage threshold and resistance"
