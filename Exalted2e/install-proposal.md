## _Exalted, Second Edition_ Character Sheet Installation Instructions

_This file is only a proposal._

`Standard Character Sheet installation instructions go here`

In addition to the above, you will need to create some rollable tables in order to ensure that the roll buttons on the character sheet function correctly. These steps can assist in your _Exalted_ game even if you do not use the buttons on the character sheet.

Rollable tables are available from the second tab from the right in the campaign window, along with card decks.

1. Create a table named `exalted`:
    1. Press "+ Add" in the Rollable Tables section of the tab.
    1. Select the "new-table" table that was created.
    1. Rename the table "exalted".
    1. Add the possible successes to the table:
        1. Press "+ Add" in the Table Items section of the table window.
        1. Name the first item "botch", and and click "Save Changes".
        1. Press "+ Add" in the Table Items section of the table window.
        1. Name the second item "0", give it a weight of 5, and click "Save Changes".
        1. Press "+ Add" in the Table Items section of the table window.
        1. Name the third item "1", give it a weight of 3, and click "Save Changes".
        1. Press "+ Add" in the Table Items section of the table window.
        1. Name the fourth item "2", give it a weight of 1, and click "Save Changes".
    1. Click "Save Changes".
1. Create a table named `exalted-damage`:
    1. Press "+ Add" in the Rollable Tables section of the tab.
    1. Select the "new-table" table that was created.
    1. Rename the table "exalted-damage".
    1. Add the possible successes to the table:
        1. Press "+ Add" in the Table Items section of the table window.
        1. Name the first item "0", give it a weight of 6, and click "Save Changes".
        1. Press "+ Add" in the Table Items section of the table window.
        1. Name the second item "1", give it a weight of 4, and click "Save Changes".
    1. Click "Save Changes".

When rolling the `exalted` table, please note that the result will display "botch" if an only if there were no successes _and_ the first roll was a botch. If you use inline rolls, you should hover your mouse over any result of 0, to ensure that it wasn't also a botch.
