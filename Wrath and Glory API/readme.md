# WH40k Wrath & Glory (Advanced API) Character Sheet

This is a multi-purpose sheet for both characters (default view) and threats based on the quickstart rules (subject to change).  

Character information is organized into multiple tabs; the Advancement tab is a placeholder roughly based on the FFG WH40k RPG system. 

This Wrath & Glory character sheet is an API enabled character sheet for mentor level gamemasters. It requires the WrathAndGlory_DieRoller.js included in the API Scripts folder at the github repository located at: https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/Wrath%20And%20Glory

### Current Version
Version 1.0 (July 18th, 2018) 

### Thanks	
Many thanks to my players (Dave, Brian, Charles, Matt, and Tyler) for their patience as I evolved the sheet and die roller (sometimes in the middle of play) over the past several weeks.

### TODO

1. Update on full release of the rules in August.
2. Automate all calculated fields.
3. Add simple dice rolls for those who do not have a mentor level account.
