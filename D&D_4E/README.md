This will be a D&D 4th Edition character sheet. It's currently just a copy of the Kitchen sink sample sheet, so by no means complete. Feel free to contribute as you see fit.

Would a TODO file be useful for co-ordinating what everyone might be working on, or is there a better way to do it on Git?

F.ex.

General layout //Unfinished, getting to it ASAP -Ville S  //Done -Alex L.

Ability Scores //Added basic scores, working on modifiers / mod + Â½ level, defenses. -Ville S  //Done -Alex L.

Skills //To do, soon. -Someone else  //Done -Alex L.
