Character sheet for Mage the Ascension, Second Edition, revised, by White Wolf Publishing.

I still need to figure out how to do the Quintessence wheel.

A big thanks goes out to Brian Shields and Benjamin Bandelow.  I used the exalted sheet they made as a starting point and as such much, maybe most, of this code it theirs.
