# D&D 5E Character Sheet

This is a **work in progress sheet** for use on Roll20.net and with the latest (5th) edition of Dungeons & Dragons.  This sheet is designed to be compatible with the full release of 5th edition and I will try to keep it as up to date as possible with the system as and when rules become publicly available.  The sheet is also designed to be usable by all Roll20 users regarless of subscription level.  An API enhanced version of the sheet is planned for the future.

### Changelog

* Entries to be added here once the sheet is ready for release.  This wont happen until the basic (free pdf) and Starter box set rules are available.

### Planned changes

* TBD

### Feedback

If you have any problems, suggestions or features you'd like to see added to the sheet then please let me know either by logging an issue on the github repo or by sending me a private message via roll20.  Please be patient when waiting for a reply, those locations are checked fairly often but, as is often the case, real life has a tendancy to get in the way!

Lastly, should anyone need it, you can find the old (and no longer updated) [DnD Next playtest version of the sheet here.](https://github.com/Actoba/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/DnDNext_Actoba) It is based of the last publicly available playtest dated October 2013.
