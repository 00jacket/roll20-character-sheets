<div class="basicdesc">When you approach a GM character with an open and earnest heart, roll+Smile. On a 10+, they regard you as friendly and you may form a Tie with them. On a 7-9, choose one from the following list:
	<ul>
		<li>You have to give them something (the GM will tell you what it is).</li>
		<li>They don't like your friends.</li>
		<li>They want you to go somewhere (the GM will tell you where).</li>
	</ul>
<strong>Note</strong>: This Move cannot be used on player characters, or on hostile and non-thinking characters. See your Friendship Move for building ties with other player characters.

When you stand up to a bully, roll+Strongarm. On a 10+, you are fierce! The bully backs down and gives you something to make you go away (their player or the GM decides). On a 7-9, they back down, but are still wary of you.
Note: Players can only bully each other in Dented campaigns, so you can only use Look Fierce! against another player in those campaigns. You can use Look Fierce! against GM characters in any campaign.

<div class="basicdesc">When you try to buy an unfriendly character's cooperation, roll+Smile and give up something of value. On a 10+, they take an action to help you out. On a 7-9, choose one from the following list:
    • They also demand a valuable secret. Reveal it now.
    • You owe them a favor in addition to the thing you gave them. The GM will tell you what it is now.
    • They don't trust you to keep your side of the deal.
Note: Bribe is for when you want a GM character to do something, not when you want them to give you a material thing. Use Make a Bargain for that.

<div class="basicmove">Lead a Cheer!</div>
<div class="basicdesc">When you try to change someone's mood, tell them a good story and roll+Smile. On a 10+, you change their mood in the way you hoped. On a 7-9, choose one from the following list:
    • They need you to listen to their complaints for a very long time.
    • They don't want you to leave.
    • They don't believe your story is true.
Note: This can be used on player characters and GM characters. Players must consent before having this move used on their characters.

<div class="basicmove">Play a Game</div>
<div class="basicdesc">When you play a game with someone, describe or play the game and determine if you won or lost it, then roll+Smile. On a 10+, choose three from the following list. On a 7-9, choose one:
    • You won a wager! Describe what was on the line and what you won.
    • Your opponent respects your skill and treats you with respect from here on out.
    • You discovered something new about this game. What is it?
    • You feel really good about yourself. Nothing can tear you down! The next time you roll a 6-, you do not damage a Part.
Note: If you played out a nano-game to perform this Move, treat any success as a 10+.

<div class="basicmove">Make a Bargain</div>
<div class="basicdesc">When you engage in trade with a GM character, roll+Scrounge and give up something of value (such as a Thing, a Device, or something intangible that you or the GM character values). On a 10+, you get all of the following. On a 7-9, choose two:
    • They give you what you want.
    • What you want is not already broken.
    • They are willing to trade with you again in the future. 
</div>
<button class="moveroll" type="roll" name="roll_move"

<div class="basicmove">Cannibalize</div>
<div class="basicdesc">When you break something to get Stuff out of it, roll+Strongarm. On a 10+, you get the Stuff easily. On a 7-9, you  get the Stuff, but... choose one from the following list:
    • It already belonged to someone (the GM will tell you who)!
    • You break something else as well (the GM will tell you what).
    • It's rude to break things! Take -1 on your next Smile roll.
</div>
Find Something
When you search for useful Stuff or Things, roll+Scrounge. If you succeed, you gain Stuff. On a 10+, pick two. On a 7-9, pick one. 
    • It's exactly what you were looking for.
    • It isn't dangerous.
    • Nobody else wants it.

Think It Through
When you reveal to the GM a fact about a problem or mystery, roll+Strongarm. On a 10+, you are completely accurate. On a 7-9, the GM will tell you one thing that is false in your statement. 

Jury-Rig
When you use Stuff or Things to repair or Upgrade a Part, including your own, roll+Scrounge. On a 10+, choose three from the following list. On a 7-9, choose one:
    • You successfully repair or modify the Part.
    • The target gains a Move (the GM will tell you what it is).
    • It doesn't use up your Stuff. 
    • It doesn't draw unwanted attention.
Note: You can use this Move on an unbroken Part to Upgrade it (for adding a useful Move on a 7-9). You can also choose to gain a Move on a still-broken Part. Most likely, this will result in an undesirable Move, known as a Glitch (see page Error: Reference source not foundError: Reference source not found).

Minor Fix-Up
Once per session, while you perform a Jury-Rig Move, if you are not also Running Away, you can describe yourself doing an additional minor repair on a different Part than the Jury-Rig's target. The target's Part is restored to its normal functionality.

Take a Breather
Once per session, when you are not Running Away, you can describe yourself doing a minor repair on yourself. One of your Parts is restored to its normal functionality.

Make a Device
When you build a new Device, if you have all the Stuff, Things, and Helpers needed to make it according to the GM, name it and roll + Helpers (the number of characters helping you make it). On a 10+, it uses up any Things you needed to make it and gains one Move, choose three from the following list. On a 7-9, choose one:
    • It doesn't use up your Stuff.
    • It gains a second Move.
    • It can be made again in the future.
    • Nobody knows you made it.

Push or Pull
When you try to move something that is bigger than you, roll+Strongarm. On a 10+, you move it where you want to. On a 7-9, you fall down and choose one from the following list: 
    • Take damage to a Part.
    • Drop your Stuff.
    • Get lost and separated from the rest of the player characters.

Run Away!
When you act to avoid getting physically damaged, (which could mean running away, dodging, or otherwise acting to avoid a danger) roll+Scrounge. On a 10+, you avoid the danger completely. On a 7-9, the GM will give you either a minor consequence or tough choice.

Fight Song
When you engage in a contest of violence (combat), performance, or sport, all characters damage one Part. The players describe what "winning" means and how they successfully won the contest. For Fluffy games, the contest must be performance or sport, such as a kickball game or dance-off.
