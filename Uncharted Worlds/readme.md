This is my first shot at a Roll20.net custom character sheet.

Hints & Features: 
- rolls for stats are automated. Just click on the icon next to the stat.
- Stats have to be entered with "+ or -". 

Todos
- Replace front/back radio buttons with something pretty
- scaling doesn't work too well
- implement user dialog for Moves that use "any" as a stat. 
After clicking the Move, the sheet needs to prompt the user for the stat to use, then roll.
Currently these Moves are not clickable.
