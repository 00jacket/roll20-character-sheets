The lay out is most done with tables, though everything has a class so it's enough to rework what you want with the CSS.

The check boxes for skills are simply to denote a character is proficient with that skill.
The player will still need to fill their total bonus in the input field.

Most buttons will prompt for Misc. modifiers. The Healing Dice button will prompt to select a target.
I mostly implemented that to test how much of a hassle it is switch between chracter sheets,
and choose targets. The sheet gets in the way of the table top, making accessing tokens kind of annoying.

The Initiative Button does require the players character token to be selected.
It's meant to be used th be used with intiative tracking script available in the API library.

Anyway, have tweaking this and look forward to seeing what changes and improvements people will make.
