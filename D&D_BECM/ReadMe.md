# D&D Basic/Expert/Companion/Masters/Rules Cyclopedia Character Sheet

This is a character sheet for use on Roll20.net with the (5th) edition of Classic Basic Dungeons & Dragons Game as well as retro clones like Dark Dungeons.  Roll some dice like it is 1986!

### Credit Where Credit is Due
The CSS and much of the layout is lifted from the excellent work of John Myles ([@Actoba](https://app.roll20.net/users/427494/actoba) on roll20) and the 5e Dungeons and Dragons sheet.
