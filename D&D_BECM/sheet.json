    "instructions": "This sheet attempts to mimic the Rules Cyclopedia version of the Basic D&D sheet but add functionality for things like skills, weapon mastery and so on, It does not currently do mass combat, though that may be added later.  This sheet borrows very heavily from the 5e Character Sheet by John Myles, realy it is just a Classic D&D mod of the sheet with some things stripped out."
