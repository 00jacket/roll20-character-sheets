Star Wars Saga Edition Character Sheet
=======================
Welcome to my rendition of the Star Wars Saga Edition Character sheet. 
My goal is to make this all encompassing for the current and any House Rules which may come up.

As this is a work in progress, please excuse the fact this is not completed.

TO DO
============
* List out all Skills with modifiers and rolls
* Use repeating function to include weapons and attacks having the user choose which Ability Mod and damage for pre-filled rolls
* Make it prettier with CSS (incorporate logos, etc)

Suggestions
============
Please send me a message if you have any suggestions.
