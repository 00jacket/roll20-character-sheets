Star Wars Saga Edition Character Sheet
=======================
Welcome to my rendition of the Star Wars Saga Edition Character sheet. 
My goal is to make this all encompassing for the current and any House Rules which may come up.

I've used this sheet (http://www.mad-irishman.net/pub_starwars.html) as a reference for the design. Because of how things are formatted with CSS I've excluded some fields to make things "prettier" and well, because I don't find them necessary.

Change log
============
July 4, 2014 - 
* Added Dropdown to choose the Defense used for Damage Threshold for PCs and NPCs

June 23, 2014 - 
* Included a tab for NPCs. Includes very limited auto-calculations as it's meant to be a shortcut to just adding an NPC. There is however the capability to add very basic calculations. For Attacks, Damage and Skills. The prefix "npc-" must be used to reference NPC Attributes

June 20, 2014 - 
* Fixed the quick Perception and Initiative rolls
* Added a prompt to all rolls for those last minute adjustments
* Included a tab for Vehicles. This was originally meant to use stand alone. The vehicle would have it's own sheet, but could be used as an addition to a PC/NPC. The prefix "vehicle-" must be used to reference Vehicle Attributes

May 15, 2014 - 
* Made XP, Credits and Carrying Wt text fields for more diverse inputs
* Included tooltip titles for inputs
* Created Size modifier drop down for Reflex and Carrying Capacity

May 7, 2014 - 
* Adjusted field size for Equipment weight, carrying capacity, XP & Max.
* Added calculations for Grapple with roll
* Added calculations for Reflex flat-footed
* Damage field changed to text input
* Fixed Attack roll button to correctly create new lines using ASCII code. Included descriptive text.

TO DO
============
* Create NPC format
* ~~List out all Skills with modifiers and rolls~~
* ~~Use repeating function to include weapons and attacks having the user choose which Ability Mod and damage for pre-filled rolls~~
* ~~Fix Attack Repeating function~~
* ~~Make it prettier with CSS (incorporate logos, etc)~~
* ~~Equipment and credits section~~
* ~~Languages~~
* ~~Feats, Talents and Force Powers area~~
* ~~Experience~~
* Include select options for age and size which would affect calculations
 * Age - Attributes
 * Size - ~~Reflex~~, Stealth, Grapple, ~~Carry Capacity~~, DT 
  * Need to figure out how to have the drop down to affect the different modifiers
  * not including Attributes as that's usually taken into effect already
