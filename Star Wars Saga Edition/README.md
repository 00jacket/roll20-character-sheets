Star Wars Saga Edition Character Sheet
=======================
Welcome to my rendition of the Star Wars Saga Edition Character sheet. 
My goal is to make this all encompassing for the current and any House Rules which may come up.

I've used this sheet (http://www.mad-irishman.net/pub_starwars.html) as a reference for the design. Because of how things are formatted with CSS I've excluded some fields to make things "prettier" and well, because I don't find them necessary.

Change log
============
May 7, 2014 - 
* Adjusted field size for Equipment weight, carrying capacity, XP & Max.
* Added calculations for Grapple with roll
* Added calculations for Reflex flat-footed
* Damage field changed to text input
* Fixed Attack roll button to correctly create new lines using ASCII code. Included descriptive text.

TO DO
============
* ~~List out all Skills with modifiers and rolls~~
* ~~Use repeating function to include weapons and attacks having the user choose which Ability Mod and damage for pre-filled rolls~~
* ~~Fix Attack Repeating function~~
* ~~Make it prettier with CSS (incorporate logos, etc)~~
* ~~Equipment and credits section~~
* ~~Languages~~
* ~~Feats, Talents and Force Powers area~~
* ~~Experience~~
* Include select options for age and size which would affect calculations
 * Age - Attributes
 * Size - Attributes, Reflex, Stealth, Grapple, Carry Capacity, DT
