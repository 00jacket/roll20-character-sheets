Upper half of the sheet is more or less finished, some minor tweaking left.

Buttons are nowhere near final - one problem I have with skill is that it is not possible to reference variable lists, but listing all SR5 skills makes the sheet way too long. Will see about that when we get Tabs inside of the sheet.

Design input for the borders around the Statblocks would be appreciated (for something closer to the original)
