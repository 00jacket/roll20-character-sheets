# FFD20 Character Sheet

### Usage

This character sheet requires a modern web browser. It is highly recommended to have the latest
version of Chrome, Firefox or Edge for the best user experience.

There are two distinct sheet types that come bundled with this character sheet: the Character and the Monster sheet type. The user can toggle between these modes from the dropdown box at the top center of the sheet aptly labeled "Sheet Type." 

#### Character Sheet Type

The Character sheet type is meant for player characters and non player characters that call for a more details-oriented approach to management. This entails your typical Roll20 sheet features: a multi-tab interface, automated calculations, sheet rolling macros, repeating sections, etc. 

#### Monster Sheet Type

The Monster sheet type is meant for monsters, to be used exclusively by the DM. It condenses everything down to one page (no tab interface), and removes autocalculations entirely in favor of giving more control to the DM with editing values. Utilizing this sheet type effectively will enable the DM to drag and drop monster tokens and keep track of their respective stats without having to wade through the tabular interface meant for more complex character types.
