In progress character sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.

Styling is inspired primarily by GCS, but also with some influence from the official sheet. The goal was to design a reponsive character sheet that would look good even with a small screen width.


TODO
 - Add support for the roll comparisons script; https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/150221/script-roll-comparisons#post-424145
 - Implement auto-calc for the point summary (if possible).
 - Fix auto-calc for attributes and skills. Waiting for this issue; https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/issues/165
