Based on the "Numenera" character sheet already on Roll20 (thanks to the original author(s)), this one has slightly different attribues, and might be used with API scripts and macros.
Note : there's a french version of the very same sheet/macros/scripts, for those interested (see "Numenera_NathasNumenera_French").

To use it "basically" : 
1) set up the sheet (NathasNumenera_Roll20_CharacterSheet_Layout.htm) and css (NathasNumenera_Roll20_CharacterSheet_CSS.css)
2) Create a character
3) Fill at least the 3 stats (current and max value)
4) Create/use a token for the character (see "NathasNumenera_setup_the_character_token.jpg")
   * Make sure it representents the character you've created
   * Assign bar1 to the "might" attribute
   * Assign bar2 to the "speed" attribute
   * Assign bar3 to the "intellect" attribute
5) Select the token.
6) Edit the character and "Use Selected token" as Default Token, and save changes.
7) Repeat steps 2 to 6 for every other characters and you're set.

To use it fully (with Macros and Scripts) : 
1) set up the API scripts (NathasNumenera_Roll20_API.js)
2) Create the macros (see NathasNumenera_Roll20_Macros.txt) : I suggest making them "Token actions" and thus must be seen by all players (except the "long rest" one, that I keep for me, the GM ;) ).
3) Create a character
4) FILL THE CHARACTER SHEET (that's important) : at least current and max values of the 3 stats, the recovery roll bonus, the Armor Speed Reduction, the recovery roll track (click "1 action") and damage track (click "Hale")
5)Create/use a token for the character (see "NathasNumenera_setup_the_character_token.jpg")
   * Make sure it representents the character you've created
   * Assign bar1 to the "might" attribute
   * Assign bar2 to the "speed" attribute
   * Assign bar3 to the "intellect" attribute
5) Select the token (and now the macro buttons must appear on top of the page).
6) Edit the character and "Use Selected token" as Default Token, and save changes.
7) Repeat steps 3 to 6 for every other characters and you're set.
