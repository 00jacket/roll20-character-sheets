# Das Schwarze Auge 4.1 Character Sheet
Character sheet for the German system "Das Schwarze Auge" (The Dark Eye) version 4.1. If you are new to the system, you might prefer the most recent version 5.

## Known Issues
* Internal names for the "Paralysis" spell and the "Kartographie" and "Stimmenimitieren" skills are "paralys" and "karthographie" and "stimmenimmitieren" (unchanged for the sake of compatibility)
* Skill checks do not take double 1 (automatic success with max. result), double 20 (automatic failure) and triple 20 (disastrous failure) into account
* Speed calculation does not take the stat Gewandtheit into account
* The whole combat system is a mess and should be used with great care only; some highlighted points:
  * TP/KK calculation does not conform to the rulebook(s)
  * "Ansage" may be higher than the corresponding skill value (TaW)
  * Target is not considered (distances class, special skills such as "Aufmerksamkeit")
  * Target hit zone cannot be selected
* Some spells are missing
  * Elemental analogs
  * Umbraporta (obscuromancy)
  * All new spells from "Elementare Gewalten"
* 1d20 checks (such as attack) always roll 2d20 for technical reasons (one real roll and the confirmation roll in case of 1/20), therefore 3D dice are less useful.
* Spells are not associated with a representation
* Rituals are basically unimplemented
* Miracles work rudimentally only and are lacking the comfort from talents and spells for activation
