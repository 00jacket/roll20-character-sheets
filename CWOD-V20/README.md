Character sheet for Vampire The Maquerade, 20th Anniversary Edition, by White Wolf Publishing.

A big thanks goes out to Brian Shields and Benjamin Bandelow. I used the exalted sheet they made as a starting point and as such much, maybe most, of this code it theirs.

Currently this is just a copy of the revised sheet.  I will be making changes in the next few days.
