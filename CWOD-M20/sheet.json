	"instructions": "# Mage: The Ascension Character Sheet\r For use in the classic World of Darkness, 20th Anniversary edition.  Designed to function much like an actual paper sheet would.  With the most notable exception being that you can roll Arete and Willpower directly from the sheet.  Also, The Dice Pool section in the center at the bottom allow one to select an Attribute and/or Ability to roll; The Other Traits and Extra Abilities may also be seleceted in the Ability drop down.  Specailty rolls will have to be handled manually, as the dice roller currently does not support tens counting as two successes.  All rolls from the sheet are of the form {Xd10}>Df1, where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  NOTE: These roll do not recognize botches. Further, the rolls will prompt the user to modify the number of dice rolled and set the difficulty.  The defaults for these are 0 and 6 respectively."
