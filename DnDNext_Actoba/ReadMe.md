# DnD Next Character Sheet

This character sheet was built for the last playtest packet released for DnD Next (Oct 2013) for use with the upcoming character sheet feature on [Roll20.net](http://roll20.net).  After the character sheet feature goes live the sheet should be fully functional and useful for all users playing DnD Next, regardless of their roll20 subscription level.

This sheet started as a reworking of another DnD Next sheet authored by David L. Hawkins (@The Story Teller)& Aaron C. Meadows and that original sheet can be found [here](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/DnDNext).

###TODO (Still being worked on)

* More help text and tooltips
* Make saving throw action macro prettier once newline bug is fixed.
* Roll 20 Wiki page
* Instructions in JSON file need updating
