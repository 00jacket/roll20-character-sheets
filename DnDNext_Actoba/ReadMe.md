Instructions will appear in here before launch.  Right now it's a TODO list of me because I'm forgetful! :)

TODO

* Pass over repeating sections to remove default rows...should in future be able to re-order rows and default row would not be included in that..also add grey BG
* Remove consumable section in inventory.  Now replaced by Utility action section
* Re-arrange sections for better flow
* Rework Section Headers to make them be a bit more distinctive
* Remove extra CSS code
* More help text and tooltips
* Pass over macros to tidy them up/make them prettier once newline bug is fixed
