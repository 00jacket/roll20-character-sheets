##Important Info
Movement, attack and mental penalties are not autocalculated from the wound locations at the moment because it would be restricted to one type of hit location table.  They can be linked to bars on tokens however and updated quickly.

A lot of autocalculation had to be removed due to errors created in die rollers, we may add more autocalc back at a later date.

Open eneded d10 rolls of the type used in NUD10 are not currently supported by Roll20, but we are working on a script for that.  Open ended rolls must be done manually at the moment.
